<HTML><BODY>I've long searched for a set of good scans of this book; of which I have added the English translation to Project Gutenberg a long time ago (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10770">ebook 10770</a>); in particular because the translation omits the illustrations, left out as they were considered 'obsolete crude drawings' -- but they are really nice, and good to keep.

<p>Luckily, this book is not in the old fraktur script, so is fairly easy to handle. Mind the spelling of some words, and please do not modernize the orthography (so for example, leave the Th in Theil as it is, and don't change it to T as in the modern spelling Teil).


<p>Have fun!
